## Introduction 

The case study is about the precition of handheld device location based on its signal strength 

The data is provided in followin format  : 

![layeout](../class1/data/layout.png)

There are 6 points where data is recorded from 166 different locations. on each location 


##  Methods 


##  EDA 


##  Data preprocessing 

##  Model 

### Knn with euclidean distance

#### with both macs included 

#### with C0

#### with CD 

### Knn with inverse square signal strength (weighted distance formula) 

#### with both macs included 

#### with C0

#### with CD 

## Summary 


## Appendix 


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = TRUE,
    comment=NA)
```

## Example

```{r}
source("case_study_functions.R", echo = T, prompt.echo = "", spaced = F)
```
